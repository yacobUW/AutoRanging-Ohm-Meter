# AutoRanging-Ohm-Meter

Welcome to the Ohm Meter Project repository! This project involves designing and implementing an ohm meter using a microcontroller with a high degree of accuracy and independence from external devices. The project includes hardware design, code implementation, testing, and a comprehensive report detailing the process and results.

## Folders

- **Code**: This folder contains all the Arduino code used for the ohm meter project. The code is responsible for controlling the multiplexer (MUX), interfacing with the external ADC, and calculating the resistance values.
  
- **Images**: In this folder, you will find visual representations and figures related to the project. These images provide a better understanding of the hardware setup.

- **Libraries**: Any external libraries or dependencies required for the Arduino code will be stored in this folder. Please ensure to include all necessary libraries for proper code execution.

- **PCB**: This folder contains the Schematic and PCB layout diagrams used in the project. It showcases the hardware design and layout, including connections to the Arduino, MUX, and external ADC.

- **Report**: Here, you will find the detailed report describing the ohm meter project. The report includes the project's introduction, hardware design, code implementation, test results, considerations, and conclusions. It also includes images and figures for visual representation.
